Withdraw these sanctions within 24 hours, or I will be forced to respond."

Your Options:

You have chosen this path. Russia will respond with force."

- SLBMs (submarine-based, stealthy)
- Strategic Bombers (piloted, recallable)

**Launch Procedure:**

1. **Select Target Country**
2. **Click "Nuclear Strike" Button**
3. **Choose Warhead Count:**
   - 1 warhead = "Limited Strike"
   - 5 warheads = "Tactical Strike"
   - 10 warheads = "Major Strike"
   - 25 warheads = "Massive Strike"
   - 50 warheads = "Devastating Strike"

4. **Confirmation Dialog Appears:**
   ```
   ⚠️ NUCLEAR STRIKE AUTHORIZATION

   Target: [Country]
   Warheads: [X]
   Estimated Casualties: [Y]

   Consequences:
   • [Country] will be devastated
   • Global radiation will increase
   • Retaliation highly likely
   • International condemnation certain
   • DEFCON will drop to 1

   This action cannot be undone.

   [Cancel] [AUTHORIZE STRIKE]
   ```

5. **NEW: Full Cinematic Sequence Plays**

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "AI opponents seem basic"

**Solution:** Install Ollama for intelligent AI
```bash
brew install ollama
ollama serve
ollama pull mistral
# In GTNW: Settings → AI Backend → Ollama → mistral
```

### "Voice features not working"

**Check:**
- F5-TTS installed: `pip install f5-tts-mlx`
- Reference audio exists in voice library
- Audio permissions granted to app
- Fallback: System TTS will be used

### "Propaganda not generating"

**Check:**
- SwarmUI running on localhost:7801, OR
- OpenAI API key configured, OR
- Other image gen backend available
- Settings → Image Generation → Select backend

### "Predictive Intelligence seems inaccurate"

**Note:** Predictions are probabilistic
- 87% doesn't mean certain
- Real intelligence has uncertainty
- Confidence levels shown
- Accuracy improves with Ollama LLM

### "The Living Room not appearing"

**Triggers:**
- Take major action (war, sanctions, nuclear threat)
- Enemy has grievances against you
- Relations below -30
- 10-20% chance per major action
- Can force: Systems → The Living Room → Initiate Call

### "Adaptive AI still feels easy"

**Explanation:**
- Needs 50+ actions to build profile
- Fully adapts after 100+ actions
- Play more games
- Check Settings → Player Profile to see adaptation level

### "Natural Language Intel not understanding"

**Tips:**
- Be specific: "Which countries are hostile to US?"

- Check suggested queries for examples
- Requires Ollama or cloud LLM backend

## 🌟 What Players Are Saying

*"I've been playing strategy games for 30 years. GTNW's The Living Room feature - having an actual conversation with Putin in his voice - is the most innovative thing I've seen. This is the future of strategy games."*

*"Declared war on Russia. Putin called me. His voice said things I wasn't expecting based on my previous actions. I realized the AI actually REMEMBERED what I did 10 turns ago. Mind blown."*

*"The propaganda posters from my campaigns are hanging on my wall. Each game creates unique art. I've never seen this in a strategy game."*

*"As a history teacher: My students are MORE engaged than with textbooks. The multi-perspective analysis teaching them critical thinking. Worth every penny... which is $0 because it's free."*

*"Predictive Intelligence said Russia would attack Ukraine in 3 turns. I didn't believe it. Turn 24: War declared. Now I check predictions every turn."*

*"The Adaptive AI is terrifying. First 3 games I dominated with covert ops. Game 4: Every AI opponent had maxed counter-intelligence. I had to completely change strategy."*

*"Played all 47 presidents. Took me 3 weeks. Best American history course I never paid for."*
