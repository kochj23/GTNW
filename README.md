## 🌟 What Players Say

### Gameplay Experience

*"Playing Lincoln during Fort Sumter gave me chills. Now I understand why he let them fire first."*

*"AI Putin remembered I broke an alliance 15 turns ago. He nuked me. The memory system is no joke."*

*"290 crises means I'm on my 8th playthrough and still encountering new scenarios."*

### Educational Impact

*"My students are arguing about the Louisiana Purchase in class now. This game works."* - History Teacher

*"Finally understood why FDR interned Japanese-Americans. Doesn't make it right, but I get the pressure he faced."* - College Student

*"Played all 47 presidents start to finish. Best American history course I never took."* - History Enthusiast
